# Introduction

ZetaForge is an AI platform designed for the rapid development and deployment of advanced AI solutions. It enables users to easily assemble reusable, customizable, and containerized Blocks into highly visual AI Pipelines.

## Why ZetaForge: The Story

In recent years, we have witnessed the exponential advancement of AI and the emergence of groundbreaking open-source repositories almost daily. We often found ourselves spending considerable time attempting to run the code on our machines. When we succeeded in trying out new, amazing AI technologies for complex industrial projects, we realized that sharing them with other team members was challenging. Often, it was quite a challenge to integrate two great repositories with our code to create a new AI system. This integration process was time-consuming, and we spent a lot of effort resolving library conflicts.

To address this, we envisioned a platform where each code repository could run in its own container to avoid library conflicts and be easily connected to other repositories to create advanced, resilient AI systems. We wanted this platform to be user-friendly while being able to access and modify the code as needed. Additionally, we aimed to ensure that we could visualize everything using web technology and perform resilient computations locally on Kubernetes or in the cloud. This dream has become a reality with the open-source release of ZetaForge.
