- typing `zetaforge launch` in your terminal, or
- running the following Python script:
```
import zetaforge
zetaforge.launch()
```

Voil√†! Now you are ready to build and run your first ZetaForge Pipeline!

## Teardown and Setup
You can enter `zetaforge teardown` in your terminal whenever you want to delete your containers.

ZetaForge relies on some containers to run that are automatically set up during the installation process.
ZetaForge developers can use the `zetaforge setup` command to set up the containers manually.


If you are using the pip package, you can stop ZetaForge by pressing `Ctrl+c` in your terminal. 
It is important to click "only once". You will be prompted if you wish to teardown your containers, as well.
