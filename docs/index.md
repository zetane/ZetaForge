# Welcome to ZetaForge Documentation!

ZetaForge is an open-source AI platform that empowers developers to deploy complex AI pipelines
fast and share their pipelines with the community and their team members very easily.

With reusable Blocks and Pipelines, ZetaForge allows you to keep up
with the pace in AI. Spend less time trying to reproduce code ran on a different platform, and focus 
more on fast delivery of AI-powered pipelines!
