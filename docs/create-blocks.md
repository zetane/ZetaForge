# Blocks

Blocks are the core elements of Pipelines. ZetaForge comes with a set of predefined Blocks; however, you can easily add Blocks to ZetaForge and share them with the community.

When Blocks are designed with reusability in mind, they can be utilized in various Pipelines in a plug-and-play fashion which saves a lot of time. ZetaForge allows users to reuse Blocks with a simple drag-and-drop and modify the Blocks when necessary without having to leave the application or follow complicated logic. These modifications can also be made with the assistance of an AI agent, such as GPT-4, within the platform to make your coding experience smoother.

Below, we explain more about Blocks and their components and how to create or modify them.

## Block Components

Each Block is composed of different components depending on its type. There are three types of Blocks:

1. Parameter Blocks: Represent the type and value of input data.
2. Compute Blocks: Implement a logic.
3. View Blocks: Create and display visualizations.

Most of the time, we create new Compute Blocks and View Blocks, and use existing Parameter Blocks. Some examples of Parameter Blocks are
`File`, `String`, `Float`, `Integer`, `String List`, and `Text`, while `Train Iris`, `Canny Edge` are Compute Block
examples, and `View Numpy` is a View Block.

Parameter Blocks do not have any input nodes; instead, they have a UI element that needs to be filled or selected. On
the other hand, Compute Blocks have both input and output nodes. View Blocks have a small box on top that will visualize
its input based on the implemented logic in that View Block.

Each Block, regardless of its type, is saved in a directory named after the Block in `frontend/core/blocks`. However,
the content of the directory representing a Block varies depending on its type.

### Components of Parameter Blocks

Parameter Blocks are represented using only one file, which is the specs file of that Block. The specs file includes all
the structural information about a Block and is stored in `frontend/core/blocks/{block-name}/specs.json`.

### Components of Compute Blocks

A directory representing a Compute Block should contain five files:

1. `computations.py`: Includes (at least) `compute(args)` and `test(args)` functions. The `compute` function implements
   the logic of the Block, while the `test` function is designed to test the compute function. The `compute` function
   returns a dictionary with keys that match the output node names from the specs file.

2. `Dockerfile`: Describes the instructions to build a Docker image. This file should always include `COPY computations.py .`.

3. `requirements.txt`: Includes packages required to run the code.

4. `run_test.py`: Builds a test image and runs that image using Docker to test the Block and saves the Docker logs.

5. `specs.json`: Includes the structural information about the Block.

### Components of View Blocks

The role of View Blocks is to create and display visualizations for the computed Block outputs.
View Blocks have the same five components as the Compute Blocks; i.e., `computations.py`, `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`,
`run_test.py`, and `specs.json`. Using View Blocks, we create HTML-formatted visualizations that will be visualized
on top of the View Block as the Pipeline runs.

## Creating Blocks

To create a Block, use a template Block listed on the sidebar. You can drag and drop a template Block, such as
`Denoising`, and modify its components to build your own Block.

## Modifying Blocks with the Block Editor

To make any modifications, click on the `</ >` icon to open the Block Editor sidebar on the right.

To modify the compute or view logic, simply edit the `compute` function. You can add as many lines of code as you like to the
`computations.py` file.

[//]: # "You can also write a specific prompt to modify the code with the help of an AI agent, such as GPT-4."

### Block Templates

The `computations.py` file should follow this template:

```python
import ...

def compute(in1, in2, in3,...):
    """
    Description
    """

    # Some code

    return {'out1': out1, 'out2': out2, ...}

def test():
    print("Running test")
    # Some test code
```

The `compute` function of a View Block follows the same logic with some slight differences:

```python
import uuid
import json
import ...

def compute(in1,...):
    """
    Description
    """

    html_template = """
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    ...
    <!-- Some html code... -->
    </html>
    """

    unique_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    html_path = f"viz_{unique_id}.html"
    in1_str = json.dumps(in1)
    # $PLACEHOLDER is a placeholder for in1 in the html template.
    html_code = html_template.replace("$PLACEHOLDER", in1_str)

    with open(html_path, "w") as file:
        file.write(html_code)

    return {"html": f"viz_{unique_id}.html"}

def test():
    print("Running test")
    # Some test code
```

The Block structure will be inferred from the signature of the compute function. Note that the return value of the
compute function should always be a dictionary with keys and values corresponding to the output of the Block.

### Saving Changes to Blocks

You can save the changes you made to a Block by compiling that Block inside the Block Editor. Just follow instructions as shown

![compile-run-block-editor.gif](assets%2Fcompile-run-block-editor.gif)

Within the files section you can modify the code, and navigate to the `Test Block` section to compile and `run test` will run the `test` function inside the `computations.py` file

<!--
The "compile files and run test" button will compile the changes and run the test functions specified by the `test`
function inside the `computations.py` file. -->
