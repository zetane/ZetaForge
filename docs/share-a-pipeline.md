# Share a Pipeline

After building a pipeline and running is sucessfully, you can share your work with your team by following these steps.

After building and successfully running a pipeline, you can share your work with your team by following these steps:

1. **Save:** Go to `File` -> `Save` or `Save As`, select the target folder, and give a name to your pipeline.
2. **Standalone Pipeline:** A folder is created that contains everything needed to run the pipeline again on another system.
3. **Send:** Preferably, zip the folder and send it to your team.
4. **Load:** Team members only need to unzip and load the pipeline by going to `File` -> `Load` -> `Pipeline` and selecting the pipeline folder.
5. **Replicate Results:** The team member just needs to press `Run` to experience the same results as you did.
