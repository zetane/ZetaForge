# Text to App

Receives input prompt and returns a fully functional frontend application.

### How to use this pipeline

- Drag and drop the pipeline onto the canvas from the side library.
- Input your desired prompt (Make me an application that receives an image as an input, and detects the shapes present)
- Input your API key inside of the password block, and make sure the API key is enclosed with "".
- Press the Run pipeline button.
- The text2app pipeline will produce a view HTML interface that takes you to the app on a web browser, and the Interface maker will take you to a chat iframe interface so you can potentially iterate over the application.
