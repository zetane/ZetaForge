The grayscale image will have shades of gray,\nwhere each pixel represents the intensity of light, with black being the weakest intensity and white being the strongest.\n\nParameters:\nimage_path (str): The file path to the colored image that needs to be converted to grayscale.\n\nReturns:\ndict: A dictionary with the key 'grayscale_image_path' and the value being the file path to the resulting grayscale image.",
