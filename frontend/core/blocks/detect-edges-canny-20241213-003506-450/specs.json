        "description": "Detects edges in a given image using the Canny edge detection algorithm.\n\nThis function takes an input image and applies the Canny edge detection algorithm to it.\nThe Canny algorithm is a multi-stage process that includes noise reduction, gradient calculation,\nnon-maximum suppression, and edge tracking by hysteresis. The output is an image highlighting\nthe edges detected in the input image.\n\nInputs:\n- image_path: The file path to the input image on which edge detection will be performed.\n- low_threshold: The lower threshold for the hysteresis procedure in the Canny algorithm.\n- high_threshold: The upper threshold for the hysteresis procedure in the Canny algorithm.\n\nOutputs:\n- edges_image_path: The file path to the output image that contains the edges detected in the input image.",
