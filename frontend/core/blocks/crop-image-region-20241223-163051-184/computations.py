def compute(image_path, coordinates):
    '''
    Crops a specific region from an image based on the provided coordinates.
    
    Parameters:
    image_path (str): The file path to the image from which a region will be cropped.
    coordinates (dict): A dictionary containing the coordinates for cropping. It includes 'x1', 'y1' for the top-left corner and 'x2', 'y2' for the bottom-right corner of the rectangle.

    Returns:
    dict: A dictionary with the key 'cropped_image_path' and the value being the file path to the cropped image.
