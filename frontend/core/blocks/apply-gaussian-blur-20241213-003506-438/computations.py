    This function applies a Gaussian blur to an image using a specified kernel size.
    The Gaussian blur is a common image processing technique used to reduce image noise and detail.
    
    Inputs:
    - image_path: The file path to the input image that will be blurred.
    - kernel_size: The size of the kernel to be used for the Gaussian blur. It should be a positive odd integer.
    
    Outputs:
    - blurred_image_path: The file path to the output image that has been blurred.
