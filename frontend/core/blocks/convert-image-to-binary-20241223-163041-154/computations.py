def compute(image_path, threshold):
    '''
    Convert a grayscale image to a binary image using a specified threshold.

    Parameters:
    image_path (str): The file path to the grayscale image that needs to be converted to binary.
    threshold (int): The threshold value used to convert the image to binary. Pixel values above this threshold will be set to 255, and those below will be set to 0.

    Returns:
    dict: A dictionary with the key 'binary_image_path' and the value as the file path to the resulting binary image after conversion.
