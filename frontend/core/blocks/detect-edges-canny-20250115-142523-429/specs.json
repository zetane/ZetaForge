        "description": "Detects edges in an image using the Canny edge detection algorithm.\n\nThis function applies the Canny edge detection algorithm to an input image.\nThe Canny algorithm is a multi-stage process that includes noise reduction,\ngradient calculation, non-maximum suppression, and edge tracking by hysteresis.\n\nParameters:\nimage_path (str): The file path to the input image on which edge detection will be performed.\nlow_threshold (int): The lower threshold for the hysteresis procedure in the Canny algorithm.\nhigh_threshold (int): The upper threshold for the hysteresis procedure in the Canny algorithm.\noutput_path (str): The file path where the output image with detected edges will be saved.\n\nReturns:\ndict: A dictionary with the key 'edges_image_path' and the value being the path to the output image.",
