## Getting Started

**Installation**
You can install ZetaForge Python Package through pip by running the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install zetaforge
```

Or, you can clone the ZetaForge GitHub repository and install from source by running:

```
git clone https://github.com/zetane/zetaforge
cd zetaforge
pip install .
```


**Install Docker Desktop and Enable Kubernetes**

You need to install Docker Desktop or any other container runtime that includes Kubernetes integration.
Follow the instructions to [install Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) from their official website.
You will need to [enable Kubernetes](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/) to use ZetaForge.

> Note: We recommend [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/download) to macOS users for efficiency and performance reasons.

## Launch ZetaForge

To launch ZetaForge, run the following command after installing via pip:
```
zetaforge launch
```

This will set up the correct services in Kubernetes, check that they are running, and then launch ZetaForge. 

If something goes wrong, you can run:

```
zetaforge setup
```

to reconfigure the container services. 

To teardown and remove the Kubernetes services, you can run:

```
zetaforge teardown
```


## Run your First Pipeline

![Demo Pipeline](assets/quick-start.gif)

To experience ZetaForge in action, start by dragging and dropping a core pipeline, such as the "Canny Edge Pipeline," from the Core Pipelines Library into your workspace. Once the pipeline is loaded, click the "Run" button to see the magic happen!


## Documentation

Explore our [official documentation](https://zetane.com/docs/) for a guide on using ZetaForge. Learn how to create your own ZetaForge blocks, assemble custom pipelines, and more. You'll also find tutorials and best practices to enhance your ZetaForge experience.

## Share a Pipeline

To share a pipeline with your team, follow these steps:

1. **Save:** Go to `File` -> `Save` or `Save As`, choose a target folder, and name your pipeline.
2. **Package and Send:** Zip the saved folder, which contains all necessary files, and share it with your team.
3. **Load and Run:** Team members can unzip the folder, load the pipeline via `File` -> `Load` -> `Pipeline`, and click `Run` to replicate the results.

This streamlined process ensures easy sharing and consistent results across your team.
